In 2006 I walked into a small screen printing shop in central Auckland, having no previous experience I got a job washing&nbsp;screens.  
While I was there I learnt how the print process worked: from colour separations to screen making and how to pull ink with a squeegee. As I worked my way up through the ranks I refined my photoshop skills, taught myself illustrator and after 3 years I was head of the artwork&nbsp;department.

I then enrolled in the two year Diploma of Digital Media at Media Design School. Still working during the day and studying web design at night, I 
graduated top of my class, earning my diploma with distinction and receiving the highest industry panel award for overall&nbsp;excellence.

After a short stint working with a small filemaker development company creating web sites and helping with support calls I moved to Nelson with my&nbsp;fiancee.

I am now working for an awesome little design shop called [Lucid](http://luciddesign.co.nz). Hanging out at the [Bridge Street Collective](http://www.bridgestreet.org.nz/), we do web development, build Shopify sites and design&nbsp;brands.

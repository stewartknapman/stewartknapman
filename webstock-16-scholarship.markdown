On my desk sits several books. Among them is On Web Typography by Jason Santa Maria and You're My Favorite Client by Mike Montiero—I had given my copy of Design Is A Job to my Dad. Next to my bed sits Web Form Design by Luke Wroblewski. Before that it was Frank Chamiero's The Shape of Design.
I say this because these are the people I look up to. I admire and follow them because they are the people at the forefront of a community. They help to push, shape and guide a community by questioning how things work. When they find the answers they then share them with the rest of the community, teaching everyone involved how to be just that little bit better at what they do.
This is a community that I am proud and excited to be apart of.

I first heard about Webstock about 7 years ago. I was working for a screen printing shop in Auckland during the day. I would then run down Queen St to study web design at the Media Design School in the evenings. We were fortunate enough to be the only class that year, and of any year, to have Darren Wood as our tutor. I'm grateful to have been given the opportunity to learn under Darren's guidance, and feel that he was instrumental in helping me to form the understanding and opinions that I now have about good web design, and what it means to be a good web designer.

He said that if we ever had the chance, then we should try to make it to a Webstock conference.

Now I work for a design studio in Nelson called Lucid, as a front end developer and designer. Lucid is mighty, but small. In the time that I have been there we have never had more than eight employees.

Both of my parents are teachers, so it seems reasonable that this is why I often find myself in a position of sharing knowledge. With the newer people in our team I teach them our workflows, chosen languages, platforms, and techniques. With the rest of our team I will regularly share new things I've found and ways to improve our tool set and the way we approach design & development.

Recently I was also fortunate enough to be able to help out at a Rails Girls weekend. Where as well as coaching I gave a talk on design and ran a front end workshop.

I have not had the opportunity to attended a Webstock conference yet. Unfortunately, as much as I know that my boss, Galen King, can see the value in sending me and would love to help me to get there, Lucid is unable to afford to do so.
For the last few years we have discussed a myriad of ways of getting to Webstock, through selling enough of a product—themes or apps—to cover the costs, or getting larger companies we work with to sponsor tickets, however none have come to fruition.

I know that if given this opportunity to attend a Webstock conference it will not only allow me learn new and important things that will help me to improve as a designer and a developer, but also allow me to bring this knowledge back to our team, in turn making Lucid and our surrounding community better.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

Yours sincerely,
Stewart Knapman.
